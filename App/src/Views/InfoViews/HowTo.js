And bull sniffing photographers are no different. That is why the camera preview in this app uses a pinch-to-zoom functionality. In other words: when using the camera, you can zoom in or out by pinching or unpinching the camera preview on your screen. Pinch wisely and have fun.'

So, if you want to rescan an image, you can simply rotate your phone to refresh the results. (For example: if your phone is in portrait mode, you can refresh the scan by rotating your screen over to landscape mode.) This feature will not work if your phone's orientation lock is on."
