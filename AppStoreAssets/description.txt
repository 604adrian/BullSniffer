💩🔬 MEASURE B.S. SCIENTICALLY 🔬💩 

Do you every think to yourself: "darn, I wish there was a way to safely and securely measure BS scientifically from the safety of my Apple device"?

If yes, then think no more! With the Bull Sniffer, it is possible to do just that! Simply:
• 📲 Open your device
• 📷 Open the Bull Sniffing app, and point the camera at the suspected source of BS
• 🔬 Enjoy the results

And that's it! Once you've successfully scanned the suspected source of BS, the app will use its highly-scientific scanning software to measure the quantity of BS emanating from this source. The results of this measurement will be displayed with an exact percentage point and a caption (the percentage point gives you the raw data; the caption tells you the significance of that data). It is possible to save the resulting photo for your later amusement. See screenshots for more details.

Use responsibly and sniff safely!
