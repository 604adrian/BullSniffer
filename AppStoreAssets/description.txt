MEASURE B.S. SCIENTIFICALLY

Do you ever think to yourself: "darn, I wish there was a way to safely and securely measure BS scientifically from the safety of my Apple device"?

If yes, then think no more! With the Bull Sniffer, it is possible to do just that! Simply:
• Open your device
• Open the Bull Sniffer app
• Point the app's camera at the suspected source of B.S.
• Snap a photo
• Enjoy the results

And that's it! Once you've successfully scanned the suspected source of BS, the app will use its highly technical scanning software to measure the quantity of BS emanating from this source. The results of this measurement will be displayed with as a photo containing an exact BS percentage point and a caption. The percentage point gives you the quantity of BS; the caption tells you the quality of the BS.

You can save these photos or share them with your friends and family. See screenshots for more details.

Use responsibly and sniff safely!
