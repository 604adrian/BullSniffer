# 💩 BULL SNIFFER 💩

## What is this app?
This app measures bulls--t. I'll explain more below.

### A brief, no bulls--t description
This is an iPhone app that measures BS scientifically. Simply point your iPhone at the suspected source of BS, and the app will scan it and determine how much BS is present as an exact percentage point. It will also provide a relevant caption to help the user gauge the significance of this measurement.

### A flashier description
💩🔬 MEASURE B.S. SCIENTIFICALLY 🔬💩 

Do you ever think to yourself: "darn, I wish there was a way to safely and securely measure BS scientifically from the safety of my Apple device"?

If yes, then think no more! With the Bull Sniffer, it is possible to do just that! Simply:
* 📲 Open your device
* 📷 Open the Bull Sniffing app, and point the camera at the suspected source of BS
* 🔬 Enjoy the results

And that's it! Once you've successfully scanned the suspected source of BS, the app will use its highly-scientific scanning software to measure the quantity of BS emanating from this source. The results of this measurement will be displayed an exact percentage point and a caption (the percentage point gives you the raw data; the caption tells you the significance of that data). You can save the resulting photo for your later amusement. See screenshots for more details.

Use responsibly and sniff safely!

### Screencaps
Some of you may wish to see screen-caps of this app to know what you are dealing with. Your prayers have been heard. The screen-caps are below.

At first glance, the captions in these screenshots might not seem immediately connected to the BS levels being detected by the Bull Sniffer's sensors. But recall that these captions are meant to express the *qualitative* side of BS: it expresses how the BS *feels*. For instance, in the picture of the monkey the high BS rating tracks the amount of BS the monkey sees in modern society (or the modern meat industry in particular). And in the third photo, the relatively low BS rating tracks the man's relative certainty about his feelings. He is 73% percent sure that he *does* in fact love you (with the remaining 27% is being picked up by the BS detector). With some practice and a little patience, one will start to understand the relationship between the quantitive and the qualitiative side of BS (i.e. the relationship that exists between the percentage points and the captions).

For those interested, more screen-caps or promotional photos can be seen on the App Store or, failing that, in the [AppStoreAssets](./AppStoreAssets/) folder.
